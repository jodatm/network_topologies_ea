# Evolutionary algorithms guided by network topologies
## Joshua Triana

This repository is intended to show the code for the paper "Evolutionary algorithms guided by network topologies" submited to the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence http://www.ceser.in/ceserp/index.php/ijai/index

The most important Figures are located on the main folder and generated in Gephi.

In the "network topologies" folder is the code for the four models, you can execute them in any python 3 env.

The classic evolutionary algorithm applied to the Graph Coloring problem was obtained from this website: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/project-idea-genetic-algorithms-for-graph-colouring/, all credits for the authors
